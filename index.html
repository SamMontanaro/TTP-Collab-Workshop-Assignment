<h1>Mission</h1>
<h4>Our mission at American Rescue Organization (ARO) is to commit our lives to aiding in the rescue of animals in need. Whether it is rescuing animals from cruelty and abuse to house in a shelter, or finding a loving family for those sheltered. With your help, we can continue in our mission to create a better world for the animals we love.

</h4>


<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>
    2,000,000 homeless pets are euthanized yearly due to the fact that it costs money to continue 
    housing them, and because there Is unfortunately not enough room to house every animal. Only 
    about 50% of cats and dogs are adopted, but our goal is to increase this amount, and to provide  
    the necessary resources to our supported organizations to continue sheltering them. 
    </p>
